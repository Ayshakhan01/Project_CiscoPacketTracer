# Project_CiscoPacketTracer(Hostel-Network)
I have tried and created a model of our Hostel network in the packet tracer.
A hostel network provides internet connectivity and local networking services to residents within a hostel. 
Cisco Packet Tracer is a simulation tool that allows us to visualize and configure various networking components.

# Components that I used:

1.Router(2811 router-2)

2.Switches(2960-switches-4)

3.End-Devices(pc-9,printer-2)

4.Cables(Copper Straight Through cables,Serial DCE cables)

Explaining a hostel network using Cisco Packet Tracer involves detailing the setup of routers, switches, access points, and client devices to create a functional network that provides internet access and local communication within the hostel environment. 
It's important to adapt the configuration to the specific requirements and layout of your hostel.

THat's It...!
